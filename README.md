# Password-Generator

## Description
This is a password generator project built for fun.

- My motivation for this project was being to build another cool complex project that would test my knowledge on Javascript.
- I built this project to challenge myself building something with a little bit of complex logic.
- From this project I learned how to think more analytically, create pseudocode alogorithms, and break down a problem into smaller pieces.

## This Project does the following
GIVEN I need a new, secure password
WHEN I click the button to generate a password
THEN I am presented with a series of prompts for password criteria
WHEN prompted for password criteria
THEN I select which criteria to include in the password
WHEN prompted for the length of the password
THEN I choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters
WHEN asked for character types to include in the password
THEN I confirm whether or not to include lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters
WHEN I answer each prompt
THEN my input should be validated and at least one character type should be selected
WHEN all prompts are answered
THEN a password is generated that matches the selected criteria
WHEN the password is generated
THEN the password is either displayed in an alert or written to the page

## How it Works
- User gets prompt on questions. Example: How many characters do you want your password to be?, Do you want to add Special characters/Numbers/Uppercase letters?, and so on.
- Once user answers all prompts the randomly generated password will display on the webpage.
