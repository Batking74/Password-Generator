# Password-Generator

### Description
This password generator project, born out of a desire for enjoyment, also serves a practical purposeâ€”I personally use it to generate passwords. Beyond its playful origin, the project has found utility in enhancing security by providing reliable and randomly generated passwords for use in various contexts.

- My motivation for this project was being to build another cool complex project that would test my knowledge on Javascript.
- I built this project to challenge myself building something with a little bit of complex logic.
- From this project I learned how to think more analytically, create pseudocode alogorithms, and break down a problem into smaller pieces.

## How it Works
- User gets prompt on questions. Example: How many characters do you want your password to be?, Do you want to add Special characters/Numbers/Uppercase letters?, and so on.
- Once user answers all prompts the randomly generated password will display on the webpage.
